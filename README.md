# The ants üêú

Webapp created to visualize ant colony optimization algorithms and how they work.

## Ant colony optimization algorithms

[ACO](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/ant-colony-optimization) is inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. At the core of this behavior is the indirect communication between the ants with the help of chemical pheromone trails, which enables them to find short paths between their nest and food sources. Blum exploited this characteristic of real ant colonies in ACO algorithms to solve global optimization problems.

## Development

First, run the husky prepare:

```bash
npm run prepare
```

then to open local server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
